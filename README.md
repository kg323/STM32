# STM32-Implementations

Author: Kenneth Galindo

# Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to exhibit any projects or work done with the STM32 microcontroller. In specific, the work done here will be presented on a **Nucleo-F303RE development board** which contains a 32-bit data bus width ARM Cortex M4 core. The topics here will range from simple projects, to more **in-depth concepts such as communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2c), FreeRTOS**, and several other topics.
